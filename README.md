## New to React?

Core Concepts to learn if you are new to ReactJS and this repo:

- Dumb Components (Component) 
- Smart Component (Container)
- Actions - define available action types
- Reducers - given previous state and an action, create a new state
- Sagas - manage or orchestrate event/action dispatching flow (called Side Effects)

## Development Workflow

Here is a suggested development workflow that works for me:

1. Define the routes, which helps to reason about the needed containers and components.

2. Implement dump components + props (state and actions).
	* Each component should define `.propTypes` for prop's validation, which will throw a warning if the container that uses it do not provides all the props that the component need.
	
3. Often, a container = a route page; a container is also where you import necessary components, actions and states (pass down to component) to form a single page.
	* if a container wants to "pre-populate" data during server rendering process, assign `Container.preload` with sagas that fetches necessary data from the API server. (refer to `containers/App.js` for an example)

4. Implement necessary Actions as you define needed containers and components (PS: this implementation is independent from previous steps). It often helps maintainability and readability if action methods are categorized into 2:
    * Actions that manipulate store directly through reducers (e.g. `actions/index.js > createRequestTypes` method), often to update the state and trigger re-render the components. 
    * "LOAD" or "TRIGGER" actions for starting a saga routine/daemon, often to make network call.

5. Implement Reducers. As you implemented the actions, you will have better idea on how to modify the states for different actions. 

### Using Redux DevTools

[Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) are enabled by default in development.

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> Toggle DevTools Dock
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> Move DevTools Dock Position
- see [redux-devtools-dock-monitor](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools-dock-monitor) for more detailed information.

If you have the
[Redux DevTools chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) installed it will automatically be used on the client-side instead.

If you want to disable the dev tools during development, set `__DEVTOOLS__` to `false` in `/webpack/dev.config.js`.
DevTools are not enabled during production.

## Deployment

`$ npm run build`

`$ npm run start`

## How Everything Works?

What initially gets run is `bin/server.js`, which does little more than enable ES6 and ES7 awesomeness in the
server-side node code. It then initiates `server.js`. In `server.js` we perform data fetching using Redux Saga ([details](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga/issues/13#ref-commit-3e8321c)). Aside from serving the favicon and static content from `/static`, the only thing `server.js` does is initiate delegate rendering to `react-router`. At the bottom of `server.js`, we listen to port `3000` and initiate the API server.

### Routing and HTML return

The primary section of `server.js` generates an HTML page with the contents returned by `react-router`. Then we perform [server-side data fetching](#server-side-data-fetching), wait for the data to be loaded, and render the page with the now-fully-loaded `redux` state.

The last interesting bit of the main routing section of `server.js` is that we swap in the hashed script and css from the `webpack-assets.json` that the Webpack Dev Server – or the Webpack build process on production – has spit out on its last run. You won't have to deal with `webpack-assets.json` manually because [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools) take care of that.

We also spit out the `redux` state into a global `window.__data` variable in the webpage to be loaded by the client-side `redux` code.

### Server-side Data Fetching

The [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) provides a mechanism for server-side data fetching from the actual backend API servers/services, when it reaches client-side (React) there is no need to do additional network call. You have to define the Sagas that a container need (refers to `containers/UserPage.js > UserPage.preload` for example) for server-side to fetch. PS: You have the flexibility to implement additional logic (e.g. handle authentication) when fetching data at server-side rendering stage, as it differs from client-side. 

### Client Side

The client side entry point is reasonably named `client.js`. All it does is load the routes, initiate `react-router`, rehydrate the redux state from the `window.__data` passed in from the server, and render the page over top of the server-rendered DOM. This makes React enable all its event listeners without having to re-render the DOM.

### Redux Middleware

Currently, we only use Saga Middleware and Logger Middleware (for development). If you need to use or add custom middlewares, you can do so by modifying `store/configureStore.dev.js` (for dev env) or `store.configureStore.prod.js` (for prod env).

### Handling Authentication

If you want to implement authentication/authorization feature, follow this issue posted on redux-saga repo - [Question: Authentication flow](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga/issues/14) - it is my main source of reference.

### Unit Tests

The project uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) to run your unit tests and the [Test Utilities](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html) from Facebook api.

An example is available at `components > User`.

To run the tests in the project, just simply run `npm test`.

## Styling

### Local Styles

This project uses [local styles](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/the-end-of-global-css-90d2a4a06284) using [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader). The way it works is that you import your stylesheet at the top of the `render()` function in your React Component, and then you use the classnames returned from that import. Like so:

`render() { const styles = require('./App.scss'); }`

Then you set the `className` of your element to match one of the CSS classes in your SCSS file, and you're good to go!

`<div className={styles.mySection}> ... </div>`

### Global Style Variables

`react-universal-saga` support global style variables by defining the variable in `theme/style.scss`. Once defined, you can use in any scss file so long it is imported (refer to `RepoPage.scss` for example).

## TODO

- [x] Use Proxy Server for better performance and security
- [ ] Simple authentication saga flow
- [ ] Provide a more realistic example that has navigation and form
- [x] Upgrade to React ^15
- [x] Use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing
- [ ] Better handling of environment variables
- [x] Borrow some best practices from react-boilerplate (refer to [react-universal-saga-modular](https://github.com/xkawi/react-universal-saga-modular))

Any contribution is welcome.
